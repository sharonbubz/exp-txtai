We want to close and up next month, which is July. That is a feasible. Yeah, and I think you know at the end of the day, I think it's like who are the people coming under the table? And yeah, I think that as well move pretty fast. So I think it's just how much is closed of the three I have like  Close to a million dollars if you will right, but obviously I'm waiting for sort of a lead term sheet if you will and they only started fundraising like two weeks ago.	2020-06-30 21:13:07.508480+00:00	2020-06-30 21:13:37.563118+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	44	1	d0a9c55620a8f39c85ff78085f37f822	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1

468	I just got to figure out who the right person or team would be to make the argument and to me it could also make the argument that it's Burt who has actually been thinking about this more holistically.	2020-06-30 21:12:12.867443+00:00	2020-06-30 21:12:42.567443+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	43	2	a2978a09ccecd93caf49ef3d267d670d	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

Just think about that for your future as we didn't think nobody interesting because my prey I might be this company. I had that strategy and it worked out pretty well for me if they do. It's amazing. Yeah that's capital was my state founder but also came in at CJ, but now the family is like even bigger right now, so they're focused mostly on a P etcetera but that that that's very interesting.	2020-06-30 21:12:12.599647+00:00	2020-06-30 21:12:42.567437+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	43	1	db96c5b306d84ae4f7499c46d6e19862	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	It's definitely going to be like a Syndicate but obviously also wanna keep some people who would be potential for sees a in this particular round because most of my VC I guess experience and network is mostly in the city says here is the world really challenge was bringing a series a fund into your seed is a signal of if they don't do the series a it's sort of like  Why and they I mean we look at it all the time.	2020-06-30 21:11:09.437178+00:00	2020-06-30 21:11:39.559429+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	42	1	7ff51b48b13fb6c07759fb054bc124fb	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	Yes, I would definitely do that attractions. I have to say so so yeah, so that's the company is for five months old. I took almost one year to transition. But you know, I've been working on this for a while, but I started watching the show is too smart. Yeah, so it's laughs and how the team read it. I was telling you right so I what we did, I mean it was like we started in 2000. It happened. So we  She changed little like, you know, short-term goals such as we had the 24/7 feed vision and we switch to let's go to where people are which is zoom and that's called the pivot and we basically recruited people when the rest of the world is like letting people go I'd worked in my in our favor in act if you will. And right now the goal is to like reinstate the, you know, basically financing and do except anywhere between like 500 to 1 million. Not the one with X2 in the Target is like total of three million, right?	2020-06-30 21:10:10.502218+00:00	2020-06-30 21:11:38.937176+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	41	1	7a761c2af6594b85bba47d60da1ff49d	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1
468	Oh, I have learned this particular technique so we can show you all that but unfortunately now I also want to be cognizant of your time and you pushed her the other meeting by two minutes or 10 minutes. Sorry. So so if you don't mind yeah, where are you guys at? Okay, let's go to traction slide or would you be able to send me this deck after?	2020-06-30 21:09:12.892308+00:00	2020-06-30 21:09:42.292311+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	40	2	8cb27d611b540a44b35635c7a48a5fb3	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	Right, like imagine. It was like your pitch. I'm almost like doing the FAQ. They wouldn't take any notes. I would just literally, you know, run it through the primers and I made speaking of which tomorrow you will get access to a Smart Prime so you can talk to some advice and ask all the religions questions that you would want some salsa.  I by the way, if someone responds with a Fickle as ones that means I already I also have like a feedback mechanism into my own system that will create like a narrative and then system will come back and re-engage you with.	2020-06-30 21:09:12.655154+00:00	2020-06-30 21:09:42.292306+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	40	1	ff0e4739b07fecba64a1a8bcd7b47d87	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	So if we were in a meeting together, like, you know any you can ask anything about that meeting of my Prime right now.	2020-06-30 21:08:12.796439+00:00	2020-06-30 21:08:42.596439+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	2	bccd74a1f0cc09f5fdc7b7293f94b5cd	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	And so we're initially thinking about sort of there's kind of three levels.	2020-06-30 21:08:12.761151+00:00	2020-06-30 21:08:42.561151+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	2	5cd94400b93029ff81842da10b838efa	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	There's either this is private and only I can ask about it.	2020-06-30 21:08:12.761153+00:00	2020-06-30 21:08:42.561153+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	2	d835cb123a74e5adbecc1bba967f37a1	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	This is completely public and anyone can ask about it.	2020-06-30 21:08:12.761155+00:00	2020-06-30 21:08:42.561155+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	2	b155dc7c605afd1ce1010d22cff0fb61	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	And then there's like a middle thing, which is people who were they can ask about it.	2020-06-30 21:08:12.761157+00:00	2020-06-30 21:08:42.561157+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	2	bd269b59fe22188411b07dafdf00187b	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	You believe in it or not, right?	2020-06-30 21:08:12.466216+00:00	2020-06-30 21:08:42.266216+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	1	1a6d95c331a7bb46e20af053a3e5c2cc	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1
468	If not, then you know, I will not say that in itself is kind of an engagement technique. So that's how we are thinking about it. But there are like transparency levels with think about it. And every memory block is also attached to certain privacy setting is what like Mark is also driving towards like having the details history. Yeah and preliminarily. We're basically we're trying to combine both, you know, giving people complete control because trust is like one of our key cornerstones. Yeah, but  Then also wanting things to be as frictionless as possible Right the to sort of things were balancing out.	2020-06-30 21:08:12.466218+00:00	2020-06-30 21:08:42.561149+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	1	6d5b9e3bef5a452d59204700a4077a6c	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	So come on and I wanna talk to you like to go to Twitter and then simply our conversation with amid Prime on the fundraising is like hey, what do you think about blocks yet?	2020-06-30 21:07:12.798146+00:00	2020-06-30 21:07:42.198146+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	38	2	67e91d6bfe35f8aead61a7c02cfe60ee	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	But otherwise your Concepts would be golden Ventures Fund Raising a newborn baby.	2020-06-30 21:07:12.763760+00:00	2020-06-30 21:07:42.163760+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	38	2	c1190cfec4ec4bae651b945d929829dc	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	Like those probably are the new constitute hair and for somebody like, you know, what made Prime has his fundraising knowledge institutional knowledge open to all the entrepreneurs, right?	2020-06-30 21:07:12.763764+00:00	2020-06-30 21:07:42.163764+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	38	2	73b0e0a2d4c45086b24c71931a0793a1	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	Better get going into this concept and even the concepts are kind of Auto generated based on what's happening in your life, you know from time to time. So the the permissions I mean, right the third process is to go after leveraging the existing slack infrastructure for permission to tell so that we don't have to build anything. But the intention is, you know, you will have specific people access to specific concept example, if you think about a meat Concepts, that would likely be your newborn.  By the way, so it's two and a half years or so.	2020-06-30 21:07:12.534453+00:00	2020-06-30 21:07:42.163756+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	38	1	645d671c62b6b5ff1ef998962877e8bc	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1

468	So if you're looking at another video that I'm less rational to right so we basically compile initial Prime for the new user experience into what we call Concepts, right?	2020-06-30 21:06:08.886099+00:00	2020-06-30 21:06:38.686099+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	37	2	59e1d55669a7b7bce52b8626bd13aad0	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	Sounds like very much like me and the the choice of the words that you would normally pick an one thing.	2020-06-30 21:05:09.468354+00:00	2020-06-30 21:05:37.868354+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	36	1	d76120e581bbfbe505de9c1a9f5d5f2d	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1
468	I want to highlight in. This one. I mean is that you see like Sharon with that little apostrophes rang and you know Prime branding around her face. The reason the reason we have like so specific about that is we don't want this to be an outer. We don't want this to be an assistant that this Nai version of yourself and gets closer to you, you know as we add more and more, you know, as your memories tax increases over a period of time.  Makes sense. It's a great way to teach it to read like I should think the zoom like I imagine, you know, it's crazy. But it's like your series a pitch could be like, you know, like imagine where investors and we did like, you know, 20 calls of you over overtime. Yeah, literally it's like and I introduce you some investor be like, what do you think of me would answer to this but asking and it would just come up and be actually it's like I imagine that the body of work and just because you know these  season 4 Were really anyone who uses Zoom all day like this. It's such a great moment in time to capture all this data in a way that couldn't be done. So super cool. It's really opportunity actually across the board and how does it how do you think through like permissioning? So like I you know, I ask you a question that I don't want I wouldn't normally answer for you or like, you know, like there's like the truth and then there's the truth.	2020-06-30 21:05:09.468356+00:00	2020-06-30 21:06:38.397323+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	36	1	26dac64b26ace74900292c54bbf324bd	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	You know just a generative model or like an intent based model. We're going to use both because people we want to give people the flexibility to ask any type of questions that they can ask that they have. Oh, yeah, and just to add to that that's also sort of like, I don't have a thing which is, you know, we are aligning the kind of the things and the Transformer that our knowledge Center regrets now and over a period of time.

What was the intention and then spit back the answer based on that sort of structured data source and getting there. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Sorry my go ahead. Oh is this a there's a couple of key like sort of underlying structural technologies that that are going to support that. So one is these memory blocks which are sort of structured.  Entities reflecting sort of memories and then the other is you know, you were going to be building up a personal Knowledge Graph for each person. And so then queries recalling information is going to be sort of looking at memory blocks to see if there's a way to answer the question and then also looking at the sort of personal Knowledge Graph that's building up as well to be able to answer them and we're actually going to use a couple of parallel Technologies.

It's more about what is the right Focus that we can go solve a problem a personal need for a specific Market segment to get that initial traction, right? That's how I would think about it.

Yeah, and in the long term, the feed could will include basically everything including like specialized Hardware devices iot devices that can record, you know, everything that's going on and but in the short term, we're going to start with zoom and slack given how much is happening there.  and given our business focus Zoom meetings and our entire transformation engine that takes speech and turns that into memory blocks and then slack all the text and turn those into memory blocks that that's going to be sort of the initial set of feeds that we're focusing on going live with	2020-06-30 21:00:03.464913+00:00	2020-06-30 21:00:22.380326+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	31	1	3180d3fdb6052577414944bc8c282a1b	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	 And over a period of time the more transform in developed the mode Roar. Aah memory box. We created this tag. That's more richer and of course the recall as how do you keep the how do you keep someone like up-to-date? What is the actual like, like, let's kind of get to like the actual input. Like how does how does the data get into your system?	2020-06-30 20:59:05.110374+00:00	2020-06-30 20:59:25.710379+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	30	2	fc875b6b5fcfbc2556bc63ede06f464e	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	How much for that Mark will talk about is on tapping this institutional knowledge and focusing everything a human being and the value of interaction of the conversation generate you think is based on the memory block in the memories fact that we create in a much more structured manner. So everything that you will hear about the technology which we didn't talk about is around creating this human structure knowledge in a specific way and we have this Transformer concept where we start we start applying these models to the Snippets of see that we generate.	2020-06-30 20:59:04.426995+00:00	2020-06-30 20:59:34.226996+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	30	1	0e2b879b3aace34fbcfc99b893c68a9f	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1

468	It on top of it. So a typical like what would the product will look like? Right so immediately jumping on what kind of product we are looking at in here. You can interact with your Prime to recall your memory blocks in your existing day-to-day interactions, whether it be like texting with your time and your mobile device or talking with your primary smart speaker or even chatting with your time through Messengers. Now, the interesting thing in here is it's not just about recalling the memory blocks that you own for.  First off but you are prime can be accessed for other people to share the knowledge that you possess right? It's a two-pronged value that is built on top of each other. Ultimately. The the goal is simple when I asked for your account actually speaking of a particular idea if you if you don't mind me encouraging that idea we were thinking about the business model where you can Like a two-factor authentication replaced with the primes because based on a test memories you can dynamically kind of create the security mechanism. That's not mother's maiden name and social security number enormous. So what it's like yeah. Anyway, you know City and my honeymoon was in and you're set so you get the idea right and I you know, we know what computers are good at what smells so good and we want to create this complement and there is so much focus on  Vigil service which we will talk a little bit more about but I guess to kind of before we get into the technology. I wanna just you know, I didn't just fish Mike Maples or I love the concept of backcasting and I couldn't help myself by about you can use it in my own page, right? Not forecasting, but thank You Adele inevitable future that's going to happen and how this ties back to you is I think is this like the concept so anyway, so I do imagine a world of synthetic trans like, you know biocenter is way too far. So, you know, it can happen. We don't know where like 2040 2050 but the idea of the digital crimes where you know, you have a version of yourself on the cloud is very and BLM, you know, we are going to make it happen and the idea of like projecting your clients and then hologram for your video conferences is going to be real the idea of putting.  In our knowledge sharing your knowledge and the idea of like knowledge economy with the transaction of the individual human being is not at a salary level, but it's a transaction college level where you can rent your Defiance where you can put your finest stock market.	2020-06-30 20:51:09.485561+00:00	2020-06-30 20:53:41.552551+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	22	1	2e9702f3070ec79826eeaad32f7a92e4	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1

468	Number 8 a good example is Elon Musk me rolling. However, they're not possible to like very similar to like bionic eyes at solving the same problem or not possible today. This is not possible to raise probably 30 40 years out there. So the goal for us is essentially vertical, you know, taking this humans and constantly better to strive ourselves and augmenting humans. Do you have to obviously become make a super human, right? So the problem that I'm solving for that story is to say that I'm following memory retention and recall issues.  Is that a human process? If no questions, then I can move on and kind of flick so that it has some memory one sensing everywhere. You'll retain large pieces of information that will be written in your brain for II II II II a short-term memory. This is essentially the working memory that we are using right now in this conversation, in this case, you would have seven to ten items that you would return in your memory blocks. Are you like seven to ten words in size for a period of 20 to 30 seconds? Whatever I said in the last minute or Mark said if you minutes ago, you already forgot but but there are some internal Transformations happening in your brain. There are comprehending all this information and there is transformation process creating the small memory blocks that will retain your memory for a long period of time right now. The interesting thing is according to psychologist judge me like the centerpieces of short-term working memory is key to intelligence and reasoning people who have mastered the techniques and Main hacking tools to commit the shorter much memory in the long-term. Have a greater capacity.  I see to synthesize and reason so whatever goal our goal is ultimately to augment their short-term working memory by creating a technological version of your memory box.	2020-06-30 20:49:10.523128+00:00	2020-06-30 20:50:39.549717+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	20	1	250e5d64675408b5b83afd520854ff1b	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1
468	Okay about what he say, right but then over a period of time, you know, obviously those memories would start to fade and even the knowledge that he like talks to me over a period of time are also starting to say over the last several months to 18 months.	2020-06-30 20:48:09.870356+00:00	2020-06-30 20:48:39.670356+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	19	2	3178742cdb30125ae4d6bd5118ed097d	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	You know, I've been like fascinated like with this retention problems of the biological memory, right and and if you look at it in the market in the landscape, there is a lot of folks on drilling holes to your brain and installing memory chips and egg.	2020-06-30 20:48:09.870358+00:00	2020-06-30 20:48:39.670358+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	19	2	dc5a4d485e21af1081ea07c268e0a650	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	I think you do that same thing with my new Venture Luther so, you know speaking of I write to if you think about it, right the core of the clerk says you can go about problem on biological problems with convergence of Technologies. And My Philosophy has always been like you don't solve the human you solve the problem, right? You know this importance of augmenting humans with technology also resonated with my business partner Larry Park, he's also legally blind started with low vision and last  Almost about like 23 24 years slow macular degeneration issue. The reason this story is important because he is an entrepreneur. He created 21 companies in aggregate Market careful of 70 billion dollars for of them are public companies. Alumina analysis are very well-known companies that he created and why is it important to me? Because he made me who I am and he spent last two years of his life with me right after we started working on our of the first one here. Pancreatic cancer and he passed away within nine months. And what would like, you know when he passed away I made this is a real entrepreneur story. Right? I literally sat in the fucking sound restaurant is like there is no way I can move the company forward without him right because like where is money how they wish her own company and I'm like still naive in terms of like, you know, the startup and environment and everything else. So I mean, obviously I had to move on and I picked up this Mantra which is like what would Larry do right and as the time passed away I used in  I switched but very well especially making hard decisions just like thinking so different perspective.	2020-06-30 20:47:07.477040+00:00	2020-06-30 20:48:39.670354+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	18	1	2c55f8e8e5aa422341cc910cd0fba99a	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1

Yeah, and you know, I'm super proud of what I did because you know, I must know stuff and I talked about it quite a bit because it's literally life-changing for people because like, you know from the time they get up to the time to sleep. It will literally change the behavior the how they do about a things right and the conference that we instill that those of you unlock this just in  not super proud and you know at the end of the day if you can find the right balance between the value that you create and get the business models that you can create.	2020-06-30 20:46:09.498195+00:00	2020-06-30 20:46:39.593906+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	17	1	3aff9a0cca8701eb81453a745f609fc6	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1

468	Yeah. No, I would love to talk about it. And I would also love to provide, you know, whatever. You know, of course. I gained a lot of knowledge people Network in often being in that space, you know, if you want to talk about it as a separate conversation. We should we should definitely take them what happened probably take you up on that separately. But yeah.  You're exactly right.	2020-06-30 20:45:17.924993+00:00	2020-06-30 20:45:18.744620+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	16	2	6201fb80cef29fbc71eb7eca4c8cb187	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2
468	Yeah, rather than continuing continuing the path of investing heavily in that like how about we start to create tools with the technologies that they have right and I can talk a little bit more about it. If you know if you're interested, but traditionally the beginning that we doesn't have like much start up and attack and another the reason I ask is my son has low vision actually, but my son is albinism so he has one Vision, so I'm always curious as to those who end up sort of my face. That's probably	2020-06-30 20:45:17.597254+00:00	2020-06-30 20:45:47.497256+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	16	1	9fc3371f129fbdd7d75624ac7822cc65	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

468	I figured maybe I founded my second set of first one failed second one is called Ira which is a service for people who are blind and low vision. So it's a it's a combination of a culmination of a iiar and human kind of all pull together to fill the gap of missing visual information. So I had a fantastic ride with that mostly back by like how credible Reese's named Lila brought your little spacer curiously.  Most about her if friend of mine who happens to be blind and interestingly enough. It was mostly sort of like the philosophical approach that I was talking to him and it all came down to blindness is not the problem. The problem is the missing visual information, right? They already adapt to living with the condition, but it's more about everybody's tries to solve the problem by creating bionic set up. I start by surgeries and Drugs and nothing worked.	2020-06-30 20:44:06.528018+00:00	2020-06-30 20:45:47.497252+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	15	1	7240539cff50b54bc365e674d5ad8816	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1

So most of our work has been in the Inner Space and also like specifically choosing the problems that has high impact people and it regions she she joined as at the same time like, you know, Mark joined us, but she went full time very fast and here they link and on this product together and having having a lot of fun.  So that Sharon I myself I love robots. I love technology. I love humans in charge of Murder by way of background. I'm an engineer by but now I have to say I'm an occasion ever as well.

Then I met Suman and you know, he's  Talking about his company and it was not only that but then it brought in the the human Neuroscience the memory and the language component and then I was just so excited about the the long-term Vision the product which you'll hear about which is sort of the stuff that we dream about and then just the path. There was a very clear path from today to then so I'll just very excited about the idea and here I am here. I am now awesome.	2020-06-30 20:41:08.495384+00:00	2020-06-30 20:41:36.255813+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	12	1	3f0e09cc166ad321836a7568e1d86c81	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

So I'm Mark at linger and I'm standing in for myself and Sharon and I think like you Sharon is our star engineer and coder and like you I'm a sort of okay engineer, but you know much better at the product and science side of things. So I you know some kind of a chief scientist here and so my background that allows  cause me to be able to do that is I did a PhD in linguistics at Berkeley area. And then I did a postdoc in Neuroscience Chicago the sister city of Toronto and so at Northwestern and then I worked at the Department of Veteran Affairs for five years as a research scientist, studying language and memory and just very interested and curious about how that works in humans.	2020-06-30 20:40:04.623960+00:00	2020-06-30 20:40:33.303657+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	11	1	151bb705f1eec146a98d8c74a55031c8	Marc Ettlinger	Suman Kanuganti	1

468	Do you have right here to them? I'm like, that's an interesting way to Market what what you effectively want to do and if there's an opportunity to partner with a group like yourselves that would actually be realistic for them make perfect sense. And I'm sure that that's on that one because  I do think we have a lot to offer in that you know in that same excitement that you should show that makes some sense.	2020-06-30 20:39:08.547529+00:00	2020-06-30 20:39:37.480920+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	10	1	8c2577f1e886eebb1986539738e49901	Suman Kanuganti	Marc Ettlinger	1
468	We often leader co-lead. We're just we're also happy to participate where that makes sense and particularly when it's a remote deal. We'd like to you know serve work with another partner on that just to get the full value of that. You'd hope that respect all the partners to fund our former entrepreneurs. We've built scaled sold companies with Executives at large public companies, but our expertise our passion area is sort of at 0 to 1 and you know,  0 to 1 and 1 to 10 and then we kind of usually get off the board and let the professionals a step in and hang out. But yeah, my particular background was a software engineer pretty average one or mediocre one, which means I got yanked into product and sales pretty quickly and turns out as much better at that and you know worked at a company move down to the valley for a while as part of the start of our office there. We raised a bunch of money. We raised a lot of money from Lehman and May of 2011. So come September 2011. We were not not in business and I moved back to Toronto to start my own company, which is a product development product development and design team and we started building mobile products like early days for you know, you kind of name it is neither then D Sony AT&T Avery Dennison MapQuest  and we were their product development aren't they didn't have any internal resources or they might have owned the back end in the end points that we connect to and so we started building out a business that way and in terms of having more and more into sort of problem Services into like more sass offerings kind of got the business going to about 10 or so in Revenue, but 70 people and then sold Zynga which point to begin the GM that think of Toronto and then Brasilia Canada which didn't really mean anything from geographically speaking with we have products that ran all over the world and focus on sort of fork. areas, they're built that what was then called applied analytics fancy name for or maybe not so fancy name for machine learning took over our entire like some mobile ads platform and we're running like seven billion Impressions a month through through that and running that way and then ran a lot of p&l for about 40 million for a bunch of sort of like a color appear to products like not not, you know, like not not like the part of those and work outwards friends are the family and then how  A team that work on FarmVille, where's friends poker and it's of the Tier 1 products. I've rolled up in ten. Uh Q. So that's that's me and that's us cool. Awesome. Last question. Do you mind telling like what's the most exciting thing like lately? What are the things that you are, you know most intrigued and most exciting about I just had a baby daughter. So that's that is what I'm most excited about right now. It's my second and I get to spend a lot of time with her during sip But actually answer your question one area that I think is really interesting just in general is I think there's we've done some really interesting sort of like a pollock fintech Investments. Well, it's a bunch of companies that almost masquerade as company expert is actually a fin tech company behind and I think that's just a really interesting opportunity right now. I think these data sets that people are collecting the owning of the payment flows between  two groups with the technology and the financial products that are out there today. There's a real opportunity to remove some of the operational and efficiencies that have plagued the businesses and the Legacy players and return that value back to you know, the buyer the seller whoever it may be whether it's a Marketplace or a transaction of some sort. So I think there's some really interesting things there. That's when I first sort of heard what you guys are doing and I Chip is actually aligned with your vision not but we've got another company called Delphia which is a hedge fund where you invest your data and I forwarded your your little this little blurb.	2020-06-30 20:35:06.762828+00:00	2020-06-30 20:39:37.847527+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	6	1	0def521fee0e429e38a11f613861f2ab	None	Suman Kanuganti,Marc Ettlinger	2

937	We have a lot of work to do. So, that's how I would think about sort of the opportunity to lead to early on just I think about when you mentioned a great brand creates Trust  I can't be a good partner for you unless you trust and I have to show you that trust. So I really think about tactical short-term. Immediate like okay that means how can I deliver on what your short-term goal is and I realized that from the standpoint, you know, I've always sort of taken an approach to the business of like now we're we're probably held to so I don't like get a you know, I don't have to have a reason to do what I would do. You know, like I like this project I want to work on it and let's just sort of build that trust and then yeah, there's a way for that to be some transaction just because that's how it works, but that's not where this is all about.  Out it's this is a much larger.	2020-08-07 22:13:40.503919+00:00	2020-08-07 22:15:13.440136+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	9	2	38b75fdce9735d453a50767ffb14c2a5	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	Of you support around the areas that will help you the most right and I think if we just keep honing in on that and he can come back with a proposal about how you do it. Yeah. Yeah, I'll give you you know, in terms of like how I see the options in here, right? So right now the company is six months or five months old. I raise some money they cannot basically like cumin seed money. I'll be going after the next round of financing.  Bigger on the financing in September right? I'm gonna already talked to like see of the VC. Is that kind of a no and collected from the feedback that era and everything right. Now. The one thing that you would have to nail down is the user Traction in the kind of understanding page here are the cohorts and here is how we will go right so it will be great if we can somehow, you know, when you think about it if you want to think from my perspective, I have a I have a shot on goal. Of course, I want to create a four million crimes out there in the world, right? So, how can we align your goals with the starter course because once the funding kicks then then inaudible would you continue to you know, push out and your strategy for going from you know, ten thousand to a million right? Like what does that strategy look like a Mercedes? So I think I think it's mostly about how we think about this relationship. Is it like immediate short-term thing or if it works out?  You feel obviously continue and the you know, everybody would need a prime right a lot of us.	2020-08-07 22:12:47.313951+00:00	2020-08-07 22:14:00.103917+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	8	1	7638e6c6d8d063909ed4cb3f5920e813	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4

And and little capabilities to be able to help get the message out. You know, there's some things we want to do to record, you know things that could be go to go out and launch that could be the way that try to drive some initial, you know, awareness and usage, you know, those are be a couple different things.

I've got to find something like, you know, usually you've had a couple flare ups or there we go. Okay.

Like I like to call our challenges of sort of  a lot of Dyslexia a lot of you know, we just have that we see things differently spatially and sort of We ingest them is different and many ways for them how that ability to sort of I always tell them if I tell you that like I literally need you to say you're going to make your bed all the way to you get to your bed. And if you stop saying it to yourself, you will forget it because you'll go. Oh my gosh, there's my Legos and then go like if you don't that's for them.

So so basically this is like putting you back in that kind of car and we wanted to roll roll out with this family because if such base of how you may want to communicate what is the value that we are trying to provide it from one use case of out of millions, but what was I saying just now? What was I saying to Chris Penrose about go to market?  For were saying what was I saying to Jamie about Larry Bach? What like, you know, what is my train of thought about was the saying yesterday? Right? So those are all the use case that we want to push out initially and that's how you know, that's where our heads are. We have a free product. We have a premium product. We have identified what we think goes into The Fray what they think goes to the premium. And what is the price point initially to basically, you know attack one of the existing in transcription. Itís not the direct competition that they're not about memory and attention there about the transition, but that's the anchor point of this show.

937	A lot of that is just in my mind how think through it now. That's that's actually great. And in fact, we did a bunch of work on that plan as well like institutional knowledge. Like when people do 42% of the information is kind of literally lost but it's think about you know, that is  Institutional knowledge that has that other people can have access without losing the core and without losing when you had certain idea or certain concept because everything is attached to the time right?	2020-08-07 21:36:47.880587+00:00	2020-08-07 21:37:17.931320+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	96	1	096f3e9670f5e2045ad498817115d694	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

It's like I was just say  like plug into that bad boy. It's got 12 years of like life in it, not every you know, the conversations and not you know, you know so much of that.  And we talked about a little bit of that Chris just about sort of the down the road is this like institutional knowledge, right?	2020-08-07 21:35:45.965605+00:00	2020-08-07 21:36:01.394881+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	95	1	8698a30fded7e9900ffc90d04d24f419	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	 Good night Sir. Yeah, I mean Jenny did bring it up Simona. It's a fear. I know we've talked about some. Different feed sources and how we prioritize and again, I think this is just you know calendar is one that I hadn't heard us talk a whole lot about it, but it seems like it'd be a very easy one.	2020-08-07 21:35:00.356476+00:00	2020-08-07 21:36:15.765603+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	94	4	340b9b8c11027e230675df1ccb598725	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	Because it's more about that you are you know.  If I had experienced violence comes inside like, you know, you have inputs that are going into your brain and then you have outputs at your Tech right even take the actions that you would take is located still motor actions that you would do but the other thing is, you know speech or you would types of things right so speech cat is like almost North of 60 to 70% of intelligence that humans are associated with because you know, that's the communication media but then you go into the real time things such as you know, are you saying on Twitter? What are you saying emails and slow?  Look at all the things that you can also attach the people and the calendar events, you know, who are the people that you asked me to wear at meetings? Right? So all the things that kind of go into the few sources, but once you plug in like everything is automated meaning the Snippets and the box, that's the base infrastructure, you know after this man's been enough time.	2020-08-07 21:34:59.868249+00:00	2020-08-07 21:35:18.679139+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	94	1	5c567a029c84757688916e8fed89e78f	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

937	I was just sort of thinking like so dependent on so much of my you know, part of the edge dies is a it done that you know, it's calendar but you're not, you know, it's there or it's in a you're overlooking in or you know, that seems to be another feed potentially the feet that we have like a list of feet focus and the focus	2020-08-07 21:33:55.290135+00:00	2020-08-07 21:34:24.990135+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	93	2	ace8620e3f43228837c929c54d88eba5	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	On the screen is ultimately your Prime, you know can be interacting, you know with others who you share that ability to act have access to and potentially even completely side and be you know, taking questions from from the world, you know, and representing what you want to what you would want to say. So it's actually it's this journey of but the architecture is there but we're going to start it off more with you know with just helping you as an individual, but it's	2020-08-07 21:33:54.971116+00:00	2020-08-07 21:34:24.271117+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	93	1	308071aef5485430f91538f644ea5e49	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

937	I mean the way I tend to think about the prime to any proud the time ultimately is, you know, when it's your body double ultimately, it's you it's you it's going to get your memories and it's actually ultimately going to be bringing back what you would hopefully have said if you were asked the question directly, right?	2020-08-07 21:32:52.539335+00:00	2020-08-07 21:33:22.339335+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	92	2	19e97cf87a49a3209d7ac44e29023cf5	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	And so right now you can interact with your Prime, you know, just you interact with the prime you can see the concepts.	2020-08-07 21:32:52.539337+00:00	2020-08-07 21:33:22.339337+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	92	2	980042b03bf3cbc3c655794944b2097c	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	Basically the initial products here in the next segment within the next month. So so we've been kind of gnawing can't talk about how it's going to kind of grow of course time. So, there you go. That's good. And one other thing that I'll just mention is it's up to the user how many feed sources they want to connect to but I think the point that Simone's trying to make is the more seed sources you connected to and allow it to to gather information from the closer that it's going to approximate.	2020-08-07 21:32:51.973392+00:00	2020-08-07 21:33:21.573396+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	92	1	616e1055708519dcf0e46a3f303f186a	Paul Behnke	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 Yeah, I mean, yeah, so I mean obviously there's you know, a lot of this is a journey, you know, not all these seeds are going to be available on day one, you know, not all the recall mechanisms are going to be available day one, but the goal, you know that Simone wants to do is actually to try to get out with you.	2020-08-07 21:31:45.633925+00:00	2020-08-07 21:32:06.333925+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	91	6	ef3605101018594558a6db1147da45cd	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	 Cool, so I think from here Chris, I'm thinking just to talk about the launch itself. Yeah. No, I think it's good.	2020-08-07 21:31:45.474490+00:00	2020-08-07 21:31:54.574492+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	91	5	4f40200b6931a5ca21a60bb0c40a00f1	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

937	Private company will develop more and more of that and same thing with faith. Like we have to want to pop into majority of your life and everything is protected secured you on the data. So that is that privacy and and color that we want to put like a Frank.  Yeah.	2020-08-07 21:31:44.809316+00:00	2020-08-07 21:31:45.444997+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	91	1	4c1fc260d3da7a25ed3fee1a4d711301	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	So those are like like three key technological pillars if you will and how the system is is made and I investigated like it's 24/7 right your Prime can be available in your slack and your LinkedIn in your Twitter and so on and so forth.	2020-08-07 21:30:49.377862+00:00	2020-08-07 21:31:19.177862+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	90	2	f959377abddf5fce436c8bae5f3a7aca	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	We have bunch of Transformers or continuously analyzing your day.	2020-08-07 21:30:49.377864+00:00	2020-08-07 21:31:19.177864+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	90	2	a3d47bcdf284ab7121d57c54820370c9	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	 You may want to read from right to left. Essentially. We have a bunch of feet sources bunch of fish sauce is nothing but tapping it here each in real time having it to you know, Eva GPS points and other calendar information and so on so forth from the feed specifically focused on speech for now, we create what we call memory Snippets think about memory stick pets are as like the raw setup information, but but it has derived information and we basically translate that into short-term memories of  seven to ten words, like very similar to your biological membranes. So what you will note what you'll start noticing here is all the architecture that we build and do will mimic close to your biological brain.  even the recall has retired and from there transform so transom is nothing but a good number of AI models to predict certain at It's associated with a memory stick and a good example is how are you feeling when you are saying but in particular message who are the people involved in that particular speaker? What kind of questions if that may carry in Africa snippet, are there any action item the particular surfaces? So you can think about is the Transformer as a piece of code that can be applied in our system and it will continue you can get richer and richer memory blocks for the for this.  System itself and ultimately, you know the idea of the recall from the Stag which we kind of covered and how that experience look like.	2020-08-07 21:29:51.348832+00:00	2020-08-07 21:31:19.177860+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	89	3	a7f0fe59c171b0f56c738916f7a1e882	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4
937	Works because yeah, I mean, I think it's okay.  so	2020-08-07 21:29:50.919469+00:00	2020-08-07 21:29:51.847681+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	89	1	0a2126d7343d123e65dc3ef0df933755	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	But the intention is you have a mechanism to be able to browse and structural stuff. But you will be able to interact with your Prime very similar to any of the existing device interaction that exist in your day-to-day right now in a natural conversation. That's a goal of your Prime. The future does hold for us to tap into this concept of ambient recall where you are not asking any question, but based on the composition based on the context that you are going about it will search for  love and memories automatically and then have a mechanism to present to you. So that way you have them continuously when you want to recall right, but for the sake of argument, the first version of our product will be interacting with your time to recall the memories in a specific way.  I don't know if you are Keen how it works at all. But if you want to I can touch like within the a second. Yeah, sure. Sure.	2020-08-07 21:28:46.353703+00:00	2020-08-07 21:28:53.033803+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	88	1	f674d58094e83fd81c3c4e2a052443a2	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	 So I will speak for another five minutes after you get like a full kind of product view.	2020-08-07 21:27:50.452237+00:00	2020-08-07 21:28:15.952237+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	87	3	77a5abe4ba5e6eedd77e2e7e6a17f4a1	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4
937	So essentially you were you can obviously access your stack and browse your stack and we have mechanisms to basically show the entire stack, you know in multiple different places and currently we have that stack option available within slack and we will talk about why are the choices what we made?	2020-08-07 21:27:50.452239+00:00	2020-08-07 21:28:15.952239+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	87	3	8cbb95a9b462b10b4c2405bb6e1efd7d	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	Then we want time to get closer and closer to who you are and what you are comprised of right the longer. The memories fact size is the greater, you know, the intelligence associated with that. So we very much like apply the AI techniques that people have written to focus more on the external knowledge internet of information that exert their and then focus in on that individual human being right. So this is AI that is applied on top of your stack. So it's your personal Alexa has to goo  Assistant yeah, it's great.	2020-08-07 21:27:50.009077+00:00	2020-08-07 21:27:52.502905+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	87	1	93fd95c1cbaa0a457f7b1f01eac7e288	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4
937	 So yeah, if you think about like literally if you map the technology to biology right you are memory short-term memory long-term memory is your stack you are biological processing that you can do is nothing but your client right?	2020-08-07 21:26:47.184284+00:00	2020-08-07 21:27:15.384284+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	86	3	ccb29430c50c6e880f7acd2e64994465	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

937	 Yeah, I mean it does I mean an account like you sort of, you know, sort of stuck in some ways, you know, 80% of this would be lost. Like what was with the biggest thing? And this idea, you know, it's just it's really it's really unique. When I first heard crime was one of those things like it didn't it didn't stick with me. I could understand the context of it. Now sort of was thinking about that. I know it's a big part of it when when Penrose was talking to me about it was talking about this Prime and I'm like, I don't know. What would that be? You know, though, isn't it is very helpful the way you do it. I look like the sort of the diagrams help too.	2020-08-07 21:25:52.276974+00:00	2020-08-07 21:27:15.690964+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	85	3	c24520b079ed330e23a6889d181e44a3	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	The good news is now we are getting there the AI is getting there. Sorry, so I will pause there and see if you even if we don't make some soap opera.	2020-08-07 21:25:52.150835+00:00	2020-08-07 21:26:11.450836+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	85	2	99960ae509a8e52eb453ab505b32e2bf	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	Because I don't have you know, they much more fitting of never forget. But when I need I want to recall in that moment in time and we do that is with a product called you're fine. So your Prime is essentially a eye on top of your stack that fetches the you know, the memory blocks that you would read. It is superior speed and is like very similar to you know, we want to get that experience closer to  or college for memory because if you have the data on your balance from memory is fucking awesome in sketching or recalling the relocation information, but you wouldn't have it.	2020-08-07 21:25:51.887801+00:00	2020-08-07 21:26:11.450833+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	85	1	ee864e4b51da65c0a4c67a489ef543ab	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4
937	 I want to say that there is heavy focus in the recall because in its entirety people will have all kinds. Information capture tool but as long as you would you wouldn't be able to recall it's useless. So you must stack is nothing but a structure representation of your memory blocks, right like similar to those seven to ten words of memory blocks that you will have in your short-term memory that we will capture and retain forever. But you are caught you were Prime is this interaction layer to make the recall possible in that moment in time?  So there are essentially memory retention and recall so you will retain with your stack and this tag is private to you and universe only you own the stack. It is controlled by the you and it is continuously uploaded by the fields and the emotion that we want to give to the people is that you will never forget.  Right, it is reducing the stress. So if you can focus on the composition in real time in that moment in time now, it's not just about registering this.	2020-08-07 21:23:52.403358+00:00	2020-08-07 21:24:55.577884+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	83	3	c3fec91b90cf4cf10153e4c30a965974	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	And you're like, oh I never would have thought that because it was in my sort of in my present. So you're able to see those intercepts with it. So that's good. So I will add a little bit of color to the memory itself, right? There are essentially three types of movie one is called sensory memory where you would retain large. Set up information, but you will only written a name for two to three seconds, right? The second one is short-term memory also refer to as short-term working memory. Now, it consists of memory blocks are equivalent to 7 to 10 words in size and you will retain them for a period of 20 to 30 seconds. So in other words, whatever I said in the last minute, we already forgot.  However, there are some internal Transformations that are happening in your brain. There are like basically comprehending all these conversations and they're creating this memory blocks that will retain in your long-term lb for a you know for a quiet period of time now, the interesting thing is short-term memory, which is the result of our is key to intelligence and business meaning people who have mastered techniques and has his mind hacking tools to commit the short-term memory to long-term memory. They tend to have greater capacity to synthesize and reason it's very similar to your computer because the more  can you have amount of memory the better you are able to emphasize it and apply intelligence to it now our You know, of course the things that not of course like the things that you said, like right now, you will forget 80% of it within 3 days, but he was the greatest lost within three days now anxiety degrades working memory capacity working memory capacity degradation will result in lower performance.  I we all know because of pandemic the levels of anxieties is not of 62 percent in total like The English. So our goal is simple. Our goal is to augment the short-term working memory of humans by creating a technological version of your memory blocks that is comprised in your in your stack. Essentially. It's a it's a it's a memories fact that belongs to you. So if you can recall any information in that moment in time	2020-08-07 21:21:50.090734+00:00	2020-08-07 21:24:20.465102+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	81	2	740a99414e73e505497aef7be0951153	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4
937	Sometimes move on good enough giving a good Baseline. It's my wife's birthday. And I figure if I could just take that slide and give it to her because if I could give her a gift it's just Christmas laughs because I'm sure he had said what it's a great so very really compelled just you know, and I find also when I find passion and sort of something and go like oh man, this is this this it's solving my problem which now you sort of are even  Tweaking things even even more rights you're able to sort of think about it in the in the times when you're not thinking it's sort of in your seeing things that sort of crossed paths with it.	2020-08-07 21:21:49.863844+00:00	2020-08-07 21:22:19.890732+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	81	1	04c7e6dcad3e69eb3fc8fbd5134ab314	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	So that's the problem that I want to solve and Sympathy by technology without drilling holes India and it goes back to the fundamental philosophy of you.	2020-08-07 21:20:47.485555+00:00	2020-08-07 21:20:59.285555+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	80	3	162580d3edf7a0898d6c9dbd23d50545	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

937	The past 18 months or so spending his time with him, but obviously my ability to recall things accurately. He used to say he used to do were fading right and I think like late 2018. I started like being super fascinated about this retention problems of biological memory, right? There is a lot of focus like and drilling holes into your brain and installing memory chips and extracting memories into your brain a good example is Elon Musk neural link. However, it is not possible today.  And it is not possible in the next 20 to 30 years. So so my goal or our goal is to be able to solve this problem of memory retention I can recall so that way you never forget what you said. Are you never forget the things that people tell to hear  Right.	2020-08-07 21:20:47.014067+00:00	2020-08-07 21:20:59.285553+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	80	1	8628f368630513dab062cd546fd01972	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4
937	Right and I obviously had to move on.	2020-08-07 21:19:46.182212+00:00	2020-08-07 21:20:15.982212+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	79	2	0b838848429433ffe73230c7a594654e	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	I know that required me to you know, think this Mantra of what would Daddy to fight like literally walking into shoes and then trying to think through what he used to say and think like him based on all the knowledge that I have.	2020-08-07 21:19:46.182214+00:00	2020-08-07 21:20:15.982214+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	79	2	8c95ded635deb6d52f73bbbf0c42fa7a	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5
937	You know by the idea that Brandon took most important thing and specifically for the things that we are doing it becomes even more critical because of the how attached this sort of information is to an individual but otherwise, maybe you know, I will start with you know, what my philosophy generally is, right. So with Ira you may have seen the basically used the technology to solve the problem of using visual information right before I write existed.  It was about how do we solve the problem of blindness? Right? So if you think about you know don't solve the human but you solve the problem and you have a unique and different way of solving the problems attached to a human condition right now and idea of the original idea even before I Ra was this like idea of augmented humans with technology, right? And this resonated with my business partner. His name is Larry Bach. He founded around 27 different companies. He Hey is the founder of alumina Nano says in aggregate Market Capital. He has around 70 billion dollars. So when I was going around preaching Iraqi pick me up. Why because he said Simone augmenting humans is technology is a concept that he super passionate about and he is legally blind himself. So he invested in me. He became my co-founder. He also became my xk2 chairman and then we went on building the company Ira for around 15 months and then he got diagnosed.  Has pancreatic cancer right after he got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within nine months he passed away and I still remember the day when I was sitting in my conference room and saying oh my God, there is no way I can push forward either without him.	2020-08-07 21:18:43.921937+00:00	2020-08-07 21:20:15.982210+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	78	1	4818da3dc731b7ecd698d09cdedf5773	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4

937	And if you have worked on our projects you may have seen kind of like how brand positioning is important to me personally, and I think generally for any product that is true.	2020-08-07 21:17:50.287592+00:00	2020-08-07 21:18:10.587592+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	77	3	2389796c28cb2419e9ec9ca46eb3deba	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

937	Yeah, I need the context like, you know after we have an understanding on what we are up to I would also want to share our immediate launch that is coming up and because that will likely you know, Define what we want to do next. Yeah. Yeah. I know starting to get you know, I'm happy to go. Yeah. Oh wonderful. Yeah - oh	2020-08-07 21:17:49.931670+00:00	2020-08-07 21:18:14.831676+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	77	1	7d243563a271fcdaf762a178d8af00cb	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

Yeah.	2020-08-07 21:16:48.197450+00:00	2020-08-07 21:18:14.831668+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	76	2	d469778038089601b69143e162a50ef6	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Paul Behnke	4
937	I had to find a relatable connection with its architect. We use a lot of these like very simple things like you know, what is its architect? I didn't speak. What is what are the what does it look like so that when I share it with my wife or someone else I have that ability to sort of provide the real story behind it. And so that's also I also find as you grow and you've seen this am sure that entrepreneur and sort of growing an organization. You also get into pde.  Business to employee that it's all sort of ground in the same thing because that tribe of people that you have behind it have to be able to tell that to so I often look at those three all go back to a strong Brown brand foundational element. We do a lot in the in that space. I mean one of my  Lee clients right now is actually reselling a lot of AT&T products their Earthly. They really To beat it B to C. And it's it's it's a lot of digital marketing. It's a lot of taking an old brand that people thought were dead and rebooting it because there really are sort of the Uber of Technology. They don't own any assets or really resellers. So, how do we tell that story? It's been a very fun unique and in same way. We've you know, they're they're dying team have a distant amazing brand designer is actually really great at packing.  He you know that like the unboxing and he's just a he's obsessed with this like what is the brand and it has the brand experience sort of come out sort of within that so there's a lot of different touch points I could share and hopefully that gives you a little bit now that out Okay cool.	2020-08-07 21:15:43.865451+00:00	2020-08-07 21:17:16.797448+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	75	1	745ef524597b02e4fc88f26ebbcd2c0f	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

What is this is what's the quick? What's the what's the story here with what is a uniqueness to it? That that's what we need to solve or sort of get our get our hands and get sore.

Do you mind if I ask you a question absolutely, just curious like the kind of project that you have done in the consumer space and maybe you know what your ideas that excitement generally in the consumer space are a lot of a lot of consumer-based.

Can you help build up for it? You know, that's that's one of those like you're dealing with a lot of Egos and stuff and I'm trying to help add like can we do it a little different and  I've been fortunate to work and be around which can be often simplistic way of telling stories of really complicated things and I really enjoy that so this opportunity when heard about it and Chris explained it just seemed unique because it's something that you kind of have to stick with it for a while and then think about how that can be translated back to the audience.	2020-08-07 21:11:42.869888+00:00	2020-08-07 21:12:12.919341+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	71	1	f3255c42decb7d72098e4f3da9807b23	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

I still been doing it for a year and great business partner in that. We do called the agency with and that also throws people off sometimes but the reality is when we built it it was about that connection. It's about a real personal relationship. I don't we don't aspire to be this massive firm that it a lot.  If people work for we are truly about being with our clients and really understanding contextually what they're trying to accomplish and then also helping them take their business and how can it be with you know, their target audience in there in there in there key who they're targeting after and that that relational element and sort of inherent in everything that we do.

That was really where I started and that was unique for me because it sort of taught me this rigor of the meeting of the meeting and how things happen and it was really unique but then I realized about 10 years into it a thought it was better to be on the agency side and went to another agency and continued always to have some connection to the AT&T and Technology world, but it was also really helpful because I've worked I learned a ton about Kellogg's and turn ton.  About Coca-Cola and it would learn about startups and all these business models just sort of fed me over the years and then eight years ago decided like everyone in some way you kind of get to a point.	2020-08-07 21:07:44.052321+00:00	2020-08-07 21:09:19.048132+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	67	1	15254196c13cec5c2153f45f62df4472	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti,Paul Behnke	5

937	I mean everyone has the free version premium and then like Microsoft, for example, they you can either get the annualized for 99 bucks or pay $9.99 a month for your own.	2020-08-07 20:50:47.757220+00:00	2020-08-07 20:51:04.457220+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	50	6	faf90131ed8367375592c8bf30a079ec	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 I have a question. Yeah, I'd be interested to hear Christmas effective. So I noticed that the for Tier 1 and premium tier 2 we're saying billed annually.  So the other players right now with everyone at home so soon black.	2020-08-07 20:50:47.601953+00:00	2020-08-07 20:51:04.457218+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	50	5	bf53ecb0fb1cc3095abd5ec323066ca7	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 you may be interested in there from a technical standpoint. The functionality is directly associated with what other Transformers that we have in the system and we are planning to capture. So for the basic basic things such as identifying authorizing yourself speaker identification entities and keywords identification, like the identifying people identifying names of things.  Recognizing sentiments and emotions are all part of the memory block free version that we will give it away. However, we have the concepts and the topics identification which is you know, you are topics that are revolving around you and hour by hour. David identifying question identifying actions. We do have plans to finish all this work for our launch because we have versions of it. You just need to test it qnet and you know ensure crime is able to respond photographer.  I will say one last thing which is there is an idea.  Doing Tier 1 and tier 2 Early Access. In other words. We are saying here one people it is the same price. But if you subscribe now when we do have premium tier 2 it will be the same parts of you.  And we are promising decentralized privacy. We are solving with that little functionality some of the you know, data management functionality and the prime functionality for It's almost like committing to something that will not be saving 99 in the future.  Yeah.  So how do they present it is a the thing that they still have to work but the goal is hey, if you sign up now, you know, the future upgrades will be sort of included and three for you before the changes is kind of get me access.  Okay.	2020-08-07 20:48:45.427411+00:00	2020-08-07 20:50:47.761948+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	48	3	bc7ef04d7ffe1f2664276b9e86b39d14	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	The team's aspect like, you know sharing your time with others would be a premium version literature.	2020-08-07 20:48:45.122277+00:00	2020-08-07 20:49:01.122277+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	48	1	3993f7b31f821f9b9a2c1badb22e9ff8	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	So so we called out so there's not lot of prime push for this particular version, but it's an introduction to find if you go for people who are accessing to	2020-08-07 20:48:45.122279+00:00	2020-08-07 20:49:01.122279+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	48	1	1f821b78a544a921d0c0d1de0c6935c6	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 The goal would be we will get better and better in, you know, teaching Prime and introduce them in the premium for short-term and long-term and even like these ones quest which is like the personalized models for yourself could be a premium version computer, right?	2020-08-07 20:47:51.292468+00:00	2020-08-07 20:48:10.692468+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	47	3	56711e87fb48a051365b16d9f27e450f	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 Yep, so even the daily digest thing, but you can argue if it can be free of Premium. But the thing is we don't have those pieces together so we can interview them that as we as you build them the data management aspect of it could also be a premium feature exporting your spectacular European feature. But as you can see, they solve blank meaning we do not have plans right now to put it out there, but we can see those are the things that are behind the table.  And then moving on to Prime in the basic length of time experience. You're not promising. The true final speed is	2020-08-07 20:46:46.507515+00:00	2020-08-07 20:48:00.350570+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	46	4	22719308f9b6d228bb21867fd26f23be	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 You know for now we can do some basic stuff and we can incorporate in the free version for engaging the users. Okay, they are sorry. I'm totally I'm good with putting it there. I'm just you know, I would also say I think yes, it's if we're looking for more things to get people to step up. I'm okay with that too. And then again you can always to me it's always like you know, you always want to say how do you keep making the free version better? You know, you know then you'll  Take some of the things that were praying move it free, but then add more on the premium sort. Of course time. You keep getting keep getting better. But like I said, I think yeah, right either way. I just I'm okay. I just, you know offer that up as an option.	2020-08-07 20:46:46.230424+00:00	2020-08-07 20:47:00.870812+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	46	2	c7b7e1d5618dee5491a4bd8807c9db79	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4

937	Yeah, so and again, I'm just also trying to think through the different things about how you want to drive up. So but you know that if I can just get back to what I said, you know, there's value there getting back to how I felt about it, you know, or you know is you know is more than I would expect I guess so I just, you know, my reaction on know I think there's something very light. I remember discussing it. We were be split.  Like insights light and we speak to Advanced inside meaning the insights like could be more about in our own selfish use cases because we want them to upgrade and give them like all this interesting insights and test it out. But Advanced inside would be we will have a separate page in loser amps right where you will can see how people can see like where is different versions of each other?

937	Stack of attention. We will always save people start. But of course you will limit the access. So so that's like is what we are saying that Unlimited  such Horizon and it it's not of be covering here because it kind of ties into the browser stack.  Playback memory block voiceprints is unavailable in the basic version upload edit new version of memory blocks. It is available and the basic features room for now right screen custom upload. The other than has to be in the web app.  Feed sources. I don't hold back. So this will be like a feature functionality. We didn't put in any of the year because it takes good amount of development work but one but we do have it in there for the Future Insights like so it's all about you had you know, most of your day was happy today are most of your day was anxious today. So the idea of insights light would be to engage with the users and you know, we can we can roll out, you know every day something else about that.	2020-08-07 20:43:48.796100+00:00	2020-08-07 20:45:15.556086+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	43	1	b31250bad3f0a2361b915d1c4a206d4e	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4

937	This is more about like engaging the users and it will also help us like, you know engage more users from Twitter and like what the hell is creating from your 5 Min.	2020-08-07 20:42:52.162133+00:00	2020-08-07 20:43:14.462133+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	42	5	ba37803dd6ed1509133386f586c63fa9	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4

937	Pigheaded but our created a flying like people understood. What does it mean? So I think that could be like, you know, if future we can change it to something else but time is easy to think about it right now, and that's Constructor.  Okay.  Good thing is, you know, we will make it like configurable. So if we are getting for some reason there is a crisis getting built like kind of talk about a month. Yeah, you can cut it down. Yes.  We talked about that like, you know that your stack that that is very interactive experience within the Luther app.	2020-08-07 20:42:51.678024+00:00	2020-08-07 20:43:14.462129+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	42	1	459da3234828f33ee4390c853eec82dc	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 Action, that's just my initial reaction.	2020-08-07 20:41:56.203666+00:00	2020-08-07 20:42:14.703666+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	41	4	f889ccc6d87b67861716bf55fab7ede5	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	Yeah, I mean II was like the dates as well because like, you know, what is the memory block?	2020-08-07 20:41:56.203668+00:00	2020-08-07 20:42:14.703668+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	41	4	b1c42dffe696d0ad8187d5a9f050bbe6	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	All right, it will require some understanding.	2020-08-07 20:41:56.203670+00:00	2020-08-07 20:42:14.703670+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	41	4	007b93734f00b8df0b2c749f430220ce	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	It's like a tweet like initially people said tweet Isaac wait 140 characters, like what can I say?	2020-08-07 20:41:56.203672+00:00	2020-08-07 20:42:14.703672+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	41	4	3cde336db86d9c7b12923a34452eb88e	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 That is my only concern on that is that you know.  It's a little bit harder for people to understand, you know, thanks guys, you know, what is actually in a memory block. We just have the conversation ourselves, you know about the size of the you know, the size of the memory block and if you're talking or not and I to me, it's like we start getting into a whole bunch of trying to explain that how that works. Whereas if you just go purely on a on a day or a time period you don't have to have to get in that hole.	2020-08-07 20:41:55.950918+00:00	2020-08-07 20:42:25.709440+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	41	2	6e31ecc2d5b2d590402869a69c7176c5	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 The other way to also think about is the number of memory blocks, right if we said hundred is a magical number on average if somebody is actually participating in a conversation in one hour like so should we do like last 1000 right? Because right now is zoom is the only feed Source. Basically we are covering laughter medic, you know. I'm meeting of meeting. So that's another way to think about it.	2020-08-07 20:40:53.156703+00:00	2020-08-07 20:41:58.713856+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	40	3	b7517154845ed6a9fdfa49a07c1fe06c	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	Is it 24 hours seems very very tight to me. I just  yeah, that's just my initial reaction. I don't know how other people feel I feel like probably should be is either weak or 72 hours. At least. I just feel like it's got a you got to give a little room there 24 hours. Yeah, they may not have even what he called and time to go into like this, right? I don't know what I don't know how other people feel that that feels weak feels like that that's potentially do.	2020-08-07 20:40:52.885977+00:00	2020-08-07 20:41:20.043593+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	40	1	6b424072d8d90a05aab353dc1c9a1675	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 So latest memory blocks for you to browse. So this is the number that we don't have a greater conviction on what that number is right now, but that will be the like Luther web app that we just discussed. Right? It could be 24 hours. It could be seven days. It could be 30 day.  It's probably an experiment that we had to run because you're trying, you know, we're trying to figure out like way to put that little but we can hit it's a it's a purely a trigger meaning how this decision will not influence any of the design or any of the technical number. We are available to the active. Yeah. Yeah.	2020-08-07 20:39:44.866213+00:00	2020-08-07 20:40:05.684496+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	3	3e547042d774e89308c6523f6368adf5	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 browse your stack	2020-08-07 20:39:44.792526+00:00	2020-08-07 20:39:45.892526+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	39	2	2fc54568a79db0f8f0974c1a0b9354eb	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 The things that are in red are the gaps for our launch to you know, those are the risks if you don't do it, then it will be arrested.  The things that are coming soon is not planned for the launch but something immediately after the launch we plan and do so on the basic side the free version.  the idea would be you know, not everything will be Associated experience their memory blocks and they will be able to you know have that stack creations and we will create this fact we will Um transcribe those memory blocks in real time.	2020-08-07 20:38:59.804289+00:00	2020-08-07 20:39:48.785199+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	38	5	c8fcefb3f894299a0e6a5c9a1f7c5da0	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
937	 The things that are in Black are the things that the functionality that we already have.	2020-08-07 20:38:59.705940+00:00	2020-08-07 20:39:03.705940+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	38	4	2c51c65bac6a4c059885d9ba5708be5b	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 But in the initial launch, it's a web app and class. However, when we the web app, we do have plans to wrap it in a desktop application. In other words. It will be very similar to  That's like application right? There will be it will be a Luthor app which the look and feel of that Luther app will be similar to the ocean and not sharing I can I can go ahead and share.  The look and feel of this load. So this look at app would be very similar to what we were just discussing in India. So the in Can would be soon enough because have an app that you've been sitting on the desktop that will also support not just like, you know the full stack experience like we have in the stack, but also the feed experience meaning you don't have to consume if you are sitting in front of the computer all day and taking the meetings you are covered for your speed, but before seven doesn't matter what meeting venues.  Hmm. Okay, that's functional. Yeah, so that's step. Number one that would like to again incremental update after the launch. I web app which would likely be purely a prime experience because we don't I mean at least the current thought processes a mobile app would be all like driven by the time experience very similar to make replicas which is conditional but it's up to discussion meaning, you know, that's that's likely after we get  the money and then we'll figure out what is our you know, where we are getting more traction and reduce pain. Yeah.  But yeah, so it will look it will be like that sort of like slag with the look and feel of what you are seeing on the screen already, right? Okay, so  Should we move forward or any questions on that? So we looked at my stag experience. We already understand Prime experience that's in the paid version that we are planning to launch. There are no questions in here. Next. I would want to discuss how we are thinking about pre and basic the things that we will be promoting and putting things that we'll be putting behind and the price point.  Okay, so we'll move on to that one next. Okay, focus on column b c and d e and f is like for the future.	2020-08-07 20:35:15.866086+00:00	2020-08-07 20:39:07.009947+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	35	2	8e74af430629e51f3b190fa721365459	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
937	 Hey is everything is there an actual app? It's going to be you know, like an Apple app or Android app that is going to be an application or is it all going to be web driven, you know for the initial launch?	2020-08-07 20:34:16.267235+00:00	2020-08-07 20:35:31.243341+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	34	4	3a191b80655b09f739ccd3a51366311e	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	Kind of the web app where you can upload a mum block and one that happened it got pushed into myself. So you can see that happening are like 8:15 a.m. Right? And the rest of this is actually from my zoom. So that's one I was in real time talking to study and then I was getting the feed in my sock.  And later on the prime interaction right where I can do is I can ask myself this question. Like what is my favorite food? And then just now I think I ask myself like something about Africa because I ingested this block just know I think I'll oven so essentially one we're talking right now. My signatures are wiped from job just now so it's hard.  To show like a live feed, but essentially when we're talking on dev that should be rolling. Nero time so you get to see all the in my block being for me or time when you're recalling you can either do search so that I do spot in Luther primed of those will come up with the block that I was talking about Scott and I thought I was talking about automatic tagging which could be another concept that I have done. It will also come up with this block. So the search experience is kind of driven through the stock itself.  And then the prime experience is something like you can ask questions about what is my favorite food? And as for the what what size saying use cases that will work on that book as well later on. So right now it works my local machine, but not quite and up yet.  Does that make sense?	2020-08-07 20:33:15.623031+00:00	2020-08-07 20:34:17.037590+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	33	1	ca8fb2a5ba5fc45ff60ac25bacc0e1a5	Sharon Zhang	Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	3

937	Like my stuff from this morning. Yeah, just just that will give a good idea on how how the stats looks and flag and people I think I think we all have a good understanding of what the prime experiences but style and sharing and showing your memory blocks from today.  Yeah, yeah, and the car the idea of the concepts will also roll into slack experience. So it's a richer web, you know web app but that has complete access to the full stack and such is more powerful and Prime is more powerful.	2020-08-07 20:32:17.631350+00:00	2020-08-07 20:32:32.462224+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	32	1	a9b69f5bea47857ac9a189a9acbb27d5	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3

937	Do you have anything to test for real in structuring the design?  I can show	2020-08-07 20:31:16.190723+00:00	2020-08-07 20:31:16.980996+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	31	3	1a5f43b3ab4c2aa650e9bbcb1bcd6dfc	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	Like moving away from recording it might affect did not have liquid confidence, but you could think about it this tool that we have the new Luther app will be a you know, basically sophisticated commercial version of what you know, we were saying this before right? So that's what it is.  So talk about that page that's marketing video sign up that connects. Umm, yeah, so that's all that and then let's say huh. You know what? I want view all my memories so they would click go subscribe and open the slack and start. Let's look at  Finally experience. I think you guys have made a have seen that before.	2020-08-07 20:31:15.650821+00:00	2020-08-07 20:31:29.490717+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	31	1	c17106949cc5e7e818a6653016b3c391	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
937	 Good, so that's that anything else on the web app.  We are basically.	2020-08-07 20:30:16.040846+00:00	2020-08-07 20:30:16.745177+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	30	4	20c034c2cd512c73c9577627d6b1e0f9	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 Okay, so we'd have like a the search bar or something like that. Yeah exactly. What happened? It's not just about like similar to Prior experience, but it will be a combination of such and you know, the specific question experience that you know intimately will be, you know, get better over a period of time. Okay, and that and that but that does exist in the web app. That's correct. Okay. All right heard about a basic watching the prime radicals. What if our Prime?	2020-08-07 20:30:15.931769+00:00	2020-08-07 20:30:43.131777+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	30	2	c1219adfe04b06f568c214a9a7160574	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
937	Plus every few seconds. Just whatever his latest is there, but if you want to I mean, I think the opening question was what did I say to share in yesterday? That wouldn't be on the first page here. So how would you find that so that they are trying to build in the touch experience?	2020-08-07 20:30:15.705814+00:00	2020-08-07 20:30:31.505817+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	30	1	55d9af6e11c52b260bd40e01c4c34ed2	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 I mean what kind of the retrieval process via the web app?	2020-08-07 20:29:18.149632+00:00	2020-08-07 20:29:33.549632+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	29	3	839ed270182e3ac12b7d30f9f83f58a2	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3

937	So we went through the radii video on quick quick question before we move on from there so that the about the web app. So the web app in and of itself, is there an interactive component to that? I think I saw something where you can add memory blocks, but is there	2020-08-07 20:29:18.058263+00:00	2020-08-07 20:29:37.558265+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	29	2	b4f8046c32450f2e4be7693e7abd5eab	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4

937	So what are the settings? What are the apps that are connected, you know plan details like, you know basic stuff very well be like self-service stock. Okay? Yeah.	2020-08-07 20:29:17.698842+00:00	2020-08-07 20:29:38.198845+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	29	1	d45e98a5b01249406b12eb6d950c0209	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 Yeah, just till I get it just to simplify the scope of the launch and get something out of there. Yeah, okay the ad what were some other? People saying that as it's almost like a second version of the product. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, I mean there are some other screens that you can see but the goal is to add value for people to solve there W is use cases and you know provide still provide a good amount of value at a initially initially we could experiment with what is engaging with people. Like for example, this one right? We have created 21 memory blocks today that are much.  Mostly happy right. So let's like, you know, it's a green was 99% of your memory blocks you very anxious to return.  I will not go over like all the strange but he I think you get the idea and this is something in development right now and hoping I shouldn't say that. Upgraded version of the my speculating that we have right now focused on what we want to achieve and obviously this may be a test page to see right.	2020-08-07 20:27:21.172121+00:00	2020-08-07 20:29:38.198840+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	27	4	a1fa21ffc0193bb38c337f73d9e6faab	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
937	 Okay, good. Well, so so yeah, this is another just and I don't want to derail this guy wants to keep going. But so if  I won't have right now this this is all what I'm saying. I won't be able to say what did somebody else say in that, you know in that discussion yesterday because it's only mine that that's fair and he's fan of mint. It's almost immediate priority meeting. Once we launch for the next thing that we will do is what was someone saying about so-and-so time. Okay so difficult, but it's all about what I'm saying.	2020-08-07 20:27:20.994376+00:00	2020-08-07 20:27:49.995654+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	27	2	db434f6d26e2145968dce8ba7b767692	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	My I have it in my head, but how course nowadays but you know some meetings you may not be speaking. These are only your terms are not like other people.	2020-08-07 20:27:20.595196+00:00	2020-08-07 20:27:27.995197+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	27	1	d84235339e0e1c4010196de8333b17db	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3

937	Calling each other so he was segment there. So text segmentation is definitely one of the like big you know, research areas. Yeah, that's kind of a waveform memory block number two. How many was yesterday? I'm making this was doing almost the entire day. I think I have a thousand of them.  So I was doing some calculation and if I think there's around 2.5 words per second at someone's eyes. Right? So one sentence is about all day. Okay. So yeah, you see it there. That's kind of like my day of meeting yesterday. And that's 1967 number of books. I would say that.	2020-08-07 20:26:18.600226+00:00	2020-08-07 20:26:46.030191+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	26	1	871707dd2ba4a914a9566aa2b092148b	Sharon Zhang	Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	3
937	So not just like arbitrarily cutting your memory block at a hundred even though your engineering or topic.	2020-08-07 20:25:18.993749+00:00	2020-08-07 20:25:48.593749+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	25	2	1e57289659a1b9aa1b7d8819fcc4b2c7	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	You're actually comparing kind of like what is the essentially similarity of the Mac following sentence the sentence are saying so if there are similar in topic or similar in semantics he would wait until then.	2020-08-07 20:25:18.993751+00:00	2020-08-07 20:25:48.593751+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	25	2	28697b0bbcb562ac56b6fba9a8b1f71d	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4

937	Month in your memory. Okay, right. Okay say if you're going and narrating quite a while basically we want to do is control that memory block within around like under 250 words. I usually that's the size of a paragraph and for a lot of they'll come that's not actually kind of like if you look at Wikipedia articles usually a hundred and fifty years kind of a complete shell the thought but so not right now Aiden which is our like on  The meantime he is doing some work on logic like segmenting them.	2020-08-07 20:25:18.755814+00:00	2020-08-07 20:25:48.593747+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	25	1	7a22e956891a9c9e7eaf0cd2ef9180ad	Sharon Zhang	Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	3
937	So essentially how the memory box out formed is based on two things like onions speakers hedge.	2020-08-07 20:24:16.121506+00:00	2020-08-07 20:24:33.021506+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	24	4	82665a293b3627f99499dc2a441a79e3	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4

937	 Just like what is a technical question because I just wasn't quite sure if I just if I had a 30-minute long Zoom call how just how do I how is that Chunk in the memory blocks, you know and how many memory blocks would come off of a call like that?	2020-08-07 20:24:16.014906+00:00	2020-08-07 20:24:37.014906+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	24	3	77d97c3ee668f4185a4c1ab570bf9a86	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	I'm just kind of curious that a question.  Question, so alright, I do something.	2020-08-07 20:24:16.014908+00:00	2020-08-07 20:24:33.021504+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	24	3	0ead5ac4620ab9178dcbb7b92b72ae19	Sharon Zhang	Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	3
937	 When users want to view the entire like view Memories Back is when it will go into the pay wall. There we go to the table and subscribe and open now open open in slack and open it now Zoom.	2020-08-07 20:24:15.879263+00:00	2020-08-07 20:24:28.979264+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	24	2	7b391030f7c2f744343141e94f445822	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
937	The engagement is changing when?	2020-08-07 20:24:15.652275+00:00	2020-08-07 20:24:18.052275+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	24	1	e9f5bcfc99c68c925b748d94ed52726d	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4
937	 So this would be a preview of how the initial screen would look like. Once they connect to those you can see like You know, they already kind of conventional there may be little bit more variations of how we are saying in the final virtue building a definitely get an idea of how it's going to look like we will have the last minute upload. They will have how many memory box that they have. They can upload the memory block by manually, but how continues to feed as well and there is a another version here.  That goes into little more details on how the dashboard will look like. Right what you just said. And what is the type and pretty much this is a fully functional memory block the only limitation however is it is showing only recent memory blocks right now. Do we put limit on hundred memory blocks? A 24 hours is something in our hand that will likely also be an experiment. We will run meaning we'll put  Limits to one day. We'll put limits to like last three days and see.	2020-08-07 20:22:14.189115+00:00	2020-08-07 20:23:18.264482+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	22	6	2e5439297a6596d5639eac3955b06195	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3

937	Show up right now. So remember this the free version and a paid version and then I will go through like literally almost all of these blocks, right so that way we understand what is the expectation that we are starting to the user. So starting with  Okay. So yeah, so this would be looking at AI the users would law land in here. We are working on ABS case that kind of follows the theme of some other of startups, you know that I'm putting together videos in the pandemic environment, like literally just doing what we are doing. So this, you know, this would be the login screen. The goal would be to test out three.  four different variations of this 2324 different market segments, but again The initial focus is to roll out a version and then start adding, you know different tests to the same thing. Right? So this is one version that we are thinking right now for rolling it out on August 20th. So they would come to the sign up. They would go login good stuff. They would connect Zoom, you know the block that we are looking at.  and then  Stuff is here.	2020-08-07 20:21:15.676668+00:00	2020-08-07 20:22:16.376276+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	21	1	72f8c6bc9b21862ada3f664469968129	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
937	 I think you said you're going to get into details of what the web app looks like, right? Okay. Yep.

937	They don't get you know the next few months or whatever. So I think I think you guys can do it on whatever load load line. It makes yep sense so it doesn't hurt the system but I think as long as you're saying expectations, I think that works. Yep. That's what I had in mind. Yep, and then they'll web app will never have the full accents right or correct. Do you not have full access?	2020-08-07 20:20:18.723569+00:00	2020-08-07 20:20:48.523575+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	20	1	6bc1e7d6ad7d594e86508ad20ac81352	None	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe,Suman Kanuganti	4

937	Been loaded inside. So yeah, you know, they still need everything to be pushed. Yeah. So what I meant was I think we will have to ultimately load everything but I think for making the user experience better, you would load everything memory blocks from today and then make the rest of the loading process almost like a synchronous soft loading. It does not hold up, you know the main UI you can talk like live with more details tonight.	2020-08-07 20:19:16.626118+00:00	2020-08-07 20:19:46.426122+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	19	1	367439ca55091d0e32fcde4867b90d7b	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3

937	 It's a very good question. I don't know you tell me the solution, but I think maybe maybe it can capture the events of scroll. We could probably refresh this number.  But I don't know. I think it's a conversation with you know what I mean? Like in stuff just bombarding slack the thousands of memory blocks as you try to scroll up or access your historical memory blocks, then you soft load those things.	2020-08-07 20:18:22.005200+00:00	2020-08-07 20:18:36.898449+00:00	Suman Kanuganti's Personal Meeting Room	18	2	edb9016e9fa1cda00c14871a437afe45	Suman Kanuganti	Sharon Zhang,Kelly Lovett,Andrew McCabe	3
